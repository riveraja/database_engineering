Summary: How to provision CloudSQL for MySQL instances using Terraform.


**Terraform** is an infrastructure automation tool to provision and manage resources in the cloud. I've been particularly interested and enjoyed using Terraform when provisioning cloud infrastructure.

In this post I'll show how to codify provisioning of a MySQL with replicas in GCP CloudSQL using Terraform from your local system.

First, make sure you installed the tool itself. [Installation instructions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) can be found in the official documentation page. It is also required to install the GCloud SDK, follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). Moving forward, I'll assume you've already set up the gcloud sdk and terraform correctly in your system.



    :::mysql
    SELECT *
    FROM sys.waits_global_by_latency
    WHERE events = 'wait/io/table/sql/handler'
    OR events LIKE 'wait/io/file/%' LIMIT 5;
