I live in Central Visayas, Philippines but was born in Western Mindanao. I am a father of one child, a husband of a loving wife, a younger brother of two siblings.

I am passionate with databases primarily [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) but have also found interest in [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

When not working I enjoy spending time with my family, watching movies, and reading books.
